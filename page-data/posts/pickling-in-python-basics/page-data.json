Maybe you scraped data from thousands of websites. Maybe you computed a zillion digits of pi. If your laptop battery dies or if python crashes, your information will be lost.</p>\n<p>Pickling allows you to save a python object as a binary file on your hard drive. After you pickle your object, you can kill your python session, reboot your computer if you want, and later load your object into python again.</p>\n<p>You could back up your pickle file to Google Drive or DropBox or a plain old USB stick if you wanted. You could email it to a friend.</p>\n<p>A word of warning: don't load pickles that you don't trust. Malicious people can make malicious pickles that may execute unexpected code on your computer (SQL injection, password brute forcing, etc).
